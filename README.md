# Clinic Signup for EAC: Bartley Temple

**Clinic Information**:

**- Location**: Bartley Temple United Methodist Church (1936 NE 8th Ave, Gainesville, FL 32641)

**- Time**: 6:30 - 9:00 pm. At Bartley, we finish at 9 pm so church staff are able to lock up after us. Each clinic night, we cap the number of patients in order to assure clinic is finished and cleaned up by 9 pm. 

**- What to Bring**: If this is your first time volunteering at EAC, I recommend bringing your laptop in order to set up your Practice Fusion account. This will allow you to review and sign the notes written by medical students after clinic.

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to **chasecomprosky@ufl.edu**
